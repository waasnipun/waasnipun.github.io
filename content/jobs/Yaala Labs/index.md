- As a backend software engineer, I am responsible for developing and maintaining the backend codebase of the company's project platform that runs on cloud. This codebase is built using technologies such as Java, Node.js, Vertx, AWS, etc.

- My main focus is on the processing engine(Node.js component) which includes handling requests for quotes and trade negotiations between two entities, and on the search engine(Java vertx component), which includes features such as order searching and quotes searching. I also work on the central order book(Java component), which handles quotes, indication trades, and other transactions.

- In terms of the processing engine and search engine, I have been responsible for their development and maintenance, including implementing new features and fixing any bugs or issues.

- I have developed a java tool that can inject FIX messages into the platform at a high rate, which is used to test the stability of the system. Additionally, I have created a validator for queued downstream messages, which helps ensure the accuracy and integrity of the data.

- I am actively involved in improving and optimizing the platform, by identifying and addressing any issues or areas for improvement.
